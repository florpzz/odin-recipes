    <h1>Medialunas Argentinas</h1>
    <img src="https://chowcation.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/medialunas.jpg" alt="">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Medialunas are the argentinian equivalent of the french pastry dessert Croissant. And although they're pretty similar in some aspects, they differ in terms of preparation, flavor and shape.</p>
    <p>"Medialuna" means "half-moon" in Spanish, and its name is given due to the crescent shape it has. This buttery goodness goes very well with the national drink "Mate", an infusion drunk in a lot of South American countries, and it's usually the chosen breakfast (or mid-afternoon snack) for thousands of argentines.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the Pastry Dough</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>525 grams of all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>300 ml of milk (preferably whole)</li>
        <li>40 grams of caster sugar</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 packets of active or dry yeast</li>
        <li>15 grams of honey (or maple syrup)</li>
        <li>10 grams of salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of lemon juice</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the Filling</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>40 grams of all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup (225 grams) of room temperature unsalted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the Syrup</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 or 1 cup of water</li>
        <li>1/2 or 1 cup of sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Start by warming up about a third of the milk you have, preferably in a water bath. Alternatively, you can use a food thermometer to track the temperature, which shouldn't exceed 40 or 43 degrees C (about 105 to 110 degrees F).</li>
    <li>Add the two packets of yeast into the milk and stir the mix until the yeast dissolves in the milk. Let the mixture stand and allow the yeast to bubble.</li>
    <li>Start mixing the butter with about 40 grams of the all-purpose flour using a mixer. The butter should be softened enough to be easily mixed with flour and save you time.</li>
    <li>When the mix is fully incorporated and completely blended, take it out and spread over parchment paper. Try to spread the mix so that it takes the shape of a square with 6 inches sides.</li>
    <li>Let the mix chill in the fridge for about 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, bring a medium-sized bowl and add the rest of the flour. Dig a well in the center of the flour, and add one whole egg, sugar, honey (or maple syrup), vanilla extract, salt, lemon juice or zest, and the rest of the milk.</li>
    <li>Prepare a paddle attachment and the cup of warm milk with yeast, that was prepared earlier. However, it's alright if the milk isn't warm anymore.</li>
    <li>Start mixing the content of the bowl while slowly adding the milk with the yeast to the mix until you get a sticky dough. This should take about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Change to kneading hook and let the machine work for 10 more minutes at low speed.</li>
    <li>Lightly flour your work surface, and place the dough over. Stretch the dough in the form of a square with 10 to 12 inches per side.</li>
    <li>Take the refrigerated flour and butter square and lay it over the other one.</li>
    <li>Pinch the edges to seal the dough, then roll the dough on itself as if it's a letter envelope, then refrigerate for about 60 minutes.</li>
    <li>Take the dough out, and place it so that the longest side is in front of you. Repeat the previous step by extending the dough then fold it as an envelope, then refrigerate again for 30 minutes. Repeat the process for a third and a final time.</li>
    <li>Start cutting the dough into long bars that are 4 inches wide, then cut each diagonally, until you have 18 to 20 triangles. (You can outline your cutting before doing it on the dough to suit the size you need)</li>
    <li>Spread and roll each triangle in the form of curved crescents (medialunas).</li>
    <li>Transfer the rolls into a generously buttered baking sheet while giving them ample space from each other</li>
    <li>Cover the medialunas with a towel or a piece of cloth for about 30 minutes, so that they start to grow a little, but don't expect much.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to about 350 degrees F (180 degrees C)</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, add the remaining egg to a teaspoon of milk, and beat them until they're fully incorporated then brush them over the medialunas</li>
    <li>Bake for 30 minutes while checking on them regularly.</li>
    <li>While the medialunas are baking, prepare the syrup by adding equal amounts of water and sugar in a suitable pot, stir to dissolve on medium heat, then continue stirring and boiling until the solution is reduced into a syrup.</li>
    <li>When the medialunas are golden brown or slightly browned, take them out of the oven.</li>
    <li>Brush the medialunas with syrup, and serve them warm, either alone or along with coffee (or mate).</li>
</ol>
