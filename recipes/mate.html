    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Mate is a South American tea-like beverage. It's drunk all over Argentina, and it can be made in differnt forms. Let's get the basics on</p>

    <h2>What you need</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A thermos</li>
        <li>A gourd (it can be made from wood, glass, ceramic, among others)</li>
        <li>A bombilla (metal straw)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Yerba mate</li>
        <li>Water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put 1 liter of water to boil, and wait until it's 80Â°C</li>
        <li>Add the water to the thermos</li>
        <li>Take the gourd and fill it with yerba mate</li>
        <li>Put the gourd a little sideways until a little mountain is formed on the side</li>
        <li>Fill the sunken side with cold water</li>
        <li>Add the bombilla where you poured the cold water</li>
        <li>Take the thermos, and add the hot water where the bombilla is, take a sip, and then spit the infusion into a sink. This is done so the yerba mate isn't burnt when we add the hot water</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Enjoy your mate!

            Sidenote: You can add any herb you want to the infusion, or even coffee. Aditionally, you take it with sugar, but know I'll judge you for that.
